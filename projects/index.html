		<p>Many of my larger projects have been as part of The Michigan Daily web team:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This past semester (Fall 2017) I lead a team in creating The Michigan Daily's first ever <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-michigan-daily/id1294495730?mt=8">mobile content app</a>. My team and I built it with React Native (plus StackOverflow and Github Issues!)</li>
			<li>Last year, I helped create the first version of The Michigan Daily's <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/no-section/michigan-daily-grade-guide-compare-class-grade-distributions-across-lsa">Grade Guide</a>, which uses data recieved from a FOIA to visualize and compare grade distributions for various classes. This project is currently being majorly revamped!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I've also worked on some personal projects as well:</p>
